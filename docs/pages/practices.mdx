# Wallet Best Practices [What does the ultimate wallet look like?]

## Transaction Privacy

By default ethereum transactions are transparent. This means anyone can see the amount, sender, recipient, and data within the transaction.

However, there are smart-contract based privacy protocols that allow you to have more control over the visibility of your transactions.

A few examples include:

- [Privacy Pools](https://privacypools.com) see ([@kohaku-eth/privacy-pools](./privacy-pools/intro.mdx))
- ~[Tornado Cash](https://tornado.cash) see ([@kohaku-eth/tornado](./tornado/intro.mdx))~

[Walletbeat](https://wallet.page) aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Ethereum wallet ecosystem.
In addition to holding wallets to best practices, and ensuring the end-users have the best possible experience.
We advise you to have a look yourself.

## Private RPC

The source of truth for data within a wallet is access to the Ethereum Network. This is done through Remote Procedure Calls (a.k.a. RPC).
It hence of importance that access to RPC (essentially what data you lookup) is private.

The traditional (and what should be the default) approach is to use a user-defined RPC endpoint.
Ideally this is a locally run ethereum node, though this may not always be feasible.

### Lightclients & Yolo Nodes

So what if, we could run a lightweight client on the users device, keep a checkpoint sync of the network, and verify results from an untrusted RPC on the fly?

This is where lightclients come in.

[Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios) is a lightclient developed by [a16z](https://a16z.com/) that does just this.
It lets you run a wrap an existing RPC and verify its results.

### Network Privacy

The extremely privacy caution person, such as a journalist or privacy enthusiast, may want to add an extra layer of protection by routing their traffic through Tor.
