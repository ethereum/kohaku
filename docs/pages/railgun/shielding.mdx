## Shielding ETH

When shielding you are essentially depositing an ERC20 token into the railgun system.
This transaction comes from the account you want to shield from.

```ts
import { Wallet } from 'ethers';

const VALUE = 10000000000000n; // 0.00001 ETH
const tx = await account.createNativeShieldTx(value); // [!code focus]

// Eoa that will send the tx
const signer = new Wallet(TX_SIGNER_KEY, provider);
await account.submitTx(tx, signer);
```

:::info
The `createNativeShieldTx` function will wrap the ETH to WETH before shielding.

## Shielding ERC20

Railgun allows for shielding any ERC20 token.

```ts
import { Wallet } from 'ethers';

const VALUE = 10000000000000n; // 0.00001 WETH
const WETH = '0x...';
const tx = await account.createShieldTx(WETH, value); // [!code focus]

// Eoa that will send the tx
const signer = new Wallet(TX_SIGNER_KEY, provider);
await account.submitTx(tx, signer);
```

## Considerations

When shielding ERC20 there are some things to consider.
Please refer to the [Railgun documentation](https://docs.railgun.org/wiki/learn/shielding-tokens) for more information.

## Fees

In addition to the expected network fees (gas fees), there is also a [Protocol Fee](https://docs.railgun.org/wiki/learn/railgun-deductions) (when shielding & unshielding) and [Broadcaster Premium](https://docs.railgun.org/wiki/learn/railgun-deductions).
Broadcaster Premiums are up to the individual Broadcasters, according to the railgun documentation "generally they are ~10% of the total gas"[*](https://docs.railgun.org/wiki/learn/railgun-deductions).
