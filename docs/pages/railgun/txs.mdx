# Transacting

After your tokens have been shielded you can use them within the railgun system.
This includes privately sending them to another railgun account, interacting with smart contracts, defi, and the like.

## Internal Transfer

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import type { RailgunAccount } from '@kohaku-eth/railgun';
import type { WalletClient } from 'viem';

declare const account: RailgunAccount
declare const wallet: WalletClient

const chainId = '11155111' as const;
const value = 10000000000000n; // 0.00001 WETH
const receiver = '0zk1qy...'; // Railgun address
const WETH = '0xfFf9976782d46CC05630D92EE39e704800271F7D' as const;

const tx = await account.transfer(chainId, WETH, receiver, value);

// Submit the tx
await wallet.sendTransaction({
  to: tx.to,
  data: tx.data,
  value: tx.value,
  gasLimit: 6000000
});
```

## Defi & Other Smart Contracts
