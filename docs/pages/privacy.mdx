# Privacy in Ethereum [Where are we at?]

## One account to rule them all

When you connect to a dApp today you are typically asked connect your wallet.
This allows for anyone to see exactly what you have interacted with, when, and how.

Spreading your identity across multiple accounts, by for example having one address per dApp could already be a good start.
Unfortunately not many wallets operate this way, most have a user experience designed for "a single active account at a time".

## Default RPC

A lot of wallets today use a default hardcoded RPC endpoint. Some even hitting the endpoint before the user has had a chance to setup their preferred configuration.

In addition to introducing centralization, this also introduced the risk of associating you with your wallet activity.

## Token Discovery

Due to the nature of how token discovery works the majority of wallets today use a centralized indexer to monitor "all transfer events" on-chain.

This allows for the discovery of new tokens right as theyre sent to your wallet.
Although this is a nice-to-have it does have privacy drawbacks.
