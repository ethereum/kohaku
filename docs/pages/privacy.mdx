## Default RPC

A lot of wallets today use a default hardcoded RPC endpoint. Some even hitting the endpoint before the user has had a chance to setup their preferred configuration.

In addition to introducing centralization, this also introduced the risk of associating you with your wallet activity.

## Token Discovery

Due to the nature of how token discovery works the majority of wallets today use a centralized indexer to monitor "all transfer events" on-chain.

This allows for the discovery of new tokens right as theyre sent to your wallet.
Although this is a nice-to-have it does have privacy drawbacks.
